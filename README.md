Water is a set of scraping, data ingestion, visualization, and machine learning tools meant to help track the United State's water resources. Previously this project was called FlowDB.

This repo also contains notebooks used to build river flow data around the U.S. for FlowDb 1.0 research at [NIPS 2020 Cimate Change Workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11154).
