Original notebooks used to build river flow data around the U.S. for research at [NIPS 2020 Cimate Change Workshop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11154). We are working on refactoring these notebooks and turning them into production pipelines as well as adding new data source for Flow DB 2.0 (see below).

09/01: Updating Repository for [FlowDB 2.0](https://flow-forecast.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FF/pages/1178501121/FlowDB+2.0) See Confluence.
